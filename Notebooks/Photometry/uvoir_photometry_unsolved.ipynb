For this module, we will use a package known as PSFEx, also from the Astromatic set of codes. \n",

We will now run PSFEx on this catalog and try to produce a PSF model for the image. We again have an input configuration file called 'psfex_conf.psfex' that specified the run-time parameters for PSFEx."
