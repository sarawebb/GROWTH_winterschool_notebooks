 Readme LAXPC

1. Install following packages
a) astropy
b) matplotlib
c) numpy
d) scipy

2. Open the given fits file
a) LAXPC events file
b) LAXPC bary correction file
c) gti file
d) response matrix file

3. Read data from the files and play around with some commands marked as '#'.

4. Calculate Time difference between events and bary file.

5. Plot lightcurves with and without including GTI*.
a) Plot the lightcurve before applying GTI
b) Apply GTI to the barycorrection file and obtain the gti time array.
c) Plot the lightcurve after applying GTI.

8. Calculating phase and fold it to obtain pulse profile.

9. Make energy spectrum for time in GTI and energy below 80keV.

10. Make PHA* spectrum for time in GTI and channel below 512.

11. Read the response file and extract respone matrix and plot countour for it


**GTI- Good Time Interval
**
