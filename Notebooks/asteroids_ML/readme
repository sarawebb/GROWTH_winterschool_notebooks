Included here are 3 files besides this readme:
(1) streak_recovery.ipynb (130 KB)
(2) run-merged.tar.gz (100 MB)
(3) check_fmo.txt (350 KB)

Locally untar the run-merged.tar.gz file in the same dir where the notebook resides.
The check_fmo.txt file should also be in the same dir

You may need to make a change in your local astropy module, specifically in the file:
astroquery/jplhorizons/__init__.py
Change 'http' to 'https' in line 20.
