These bands can be seen in the spectra of our standard star. The target spectrum is also absorbed in these bands. We can correct for this by measuring the fraction of the standard star's light absorbed as a function of wavelength compared to an extrapolation of the standard star's continuum across these bands. We can then scale this absorption strength to match the fractional absorption in the target spectrum and thus divide out the telluric absorption. This works well as long as the atmospheric conditions remain similar."
